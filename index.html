      <h2>About Our Project</h2>
      <p>
        This project focuses on analyzing real-time health data collected from wearable devices 
        to identify potential risk factors for miscarriage. By integrating data such as heart rate, 
        stress levels, sleep patterns, and physical activity, we aim to develop predictive models 
        to assist healthcare providers in delivering personalized care.
